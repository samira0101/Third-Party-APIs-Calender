# Third-Party-APIs-Calender

Built a simple calender where users can save their shedules on each hour making it an interactive application. for the user. Started code has been provided in HTML and CSS with few additions in HTML. Added script.js which was generated with Jquery.

The motivation behind this project was in order to built a project whilst using Jquery. Allowing to make the code look less condensed appearing neater than javascript. Whilst, practising javascript to grasp the meaning behind the code.

I was able to create the shedule calender as shown in the preview. This was done by creating a time block in HTML from 9am-5pm shedule.

The top of the calender shows live date and time.

Users can create appointments in the calender by entering data.

Users can save their appointments in the local storage by clicking on save button.

In the future I would like to be able to add planner highlighter in order to higlight with different colours past/present/future appointment. 

I also tried to retrieve the data from local storage and have it saved when on refresh however, was only able to view it on local storage but not able to retrieve it.
